--->  We Write Java inside HTML This feature Provide by java server pages(JSP).


Why We Need JSP ?
	
	-> Response Send From Servlet to client is static we can't give design to client page
	   That's give client a boring view. we need to give a perfect designed view .
	
	-> If we design the page using servlet that why we need to write all code into "pw.println()"
	   This is note use full way to design pages.
	   
	   
Jsp Tags Types {

		Directives;
		Declaration
		Scriptlet
		Expression	      
	
	-->	Directives
			The jsp directives are messages that tells the web container 
			how to translate a JSP page into the corresponding servlet.
			
			<%@ page/include/taglib  >
			
			import
			contentType
			extends
			info
			buffer
			language
			isELIgnored
			isThreadSafe
			autoFlush
			session
			pageEncoding
			errorPage
			isErrorPage
 	   
 	-->	Declaration
 			The JSP declaration tag is used to declare fields and methods.
			
			The declaration of jsp declaration tag is placed outside the _jspService() method.
			
 			<%! int i=10; %>
 	
 	-->	Scriptlet
 			In JSP, java code can be written inside the jsp page using the scriptlet tag.
 			
 			
 			
 			<% Java Source Code %>
 	 
 	-->	Expression
 			The code placed within JSP expression tag is written to the output stream of the response. 
 			So you need not write out.print() to write data.
 			
 			It is mainly used to print the values of variable or method.
 			
 			<%=  statement %>
